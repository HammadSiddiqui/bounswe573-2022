### Week 1 - Git & Wikidata
#### Git: 
Git is one of a version control and management system that is extensively used in software development. 

The beauty of version control management system like Git is that it can be used beyond software development to control versions for other types of digital assets like word documents, or graphic designs.

Some of the widely used git commands are as follows:

- `git init` : This command is used initialize a new git repository
- `git add` : This command is used register objects and files into the newly initialized git repository
- `git commit` : This command is used register changes that were made in the objects and/or files. This is where git creates a new version of the changes, called the commit "hash".
- `git push` : This command is used push the latest changes to a remote  server

#### Wikidata:  
[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) is a crowdsourced, mega information site, (like wikipedia). It contains knowledgebase to enumerous amounts of topics which are maintained by the users in the wikidata community.

An example page about Git on Wiki can be found below:
[Git on Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q186055)

The Wikidata also offers access to the data over an API. [The link to the Wikidata API](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Data_access)

Like Git, wikidata also keeps a track of the version of a particular topic. For e.g, we can look at the history of the information update on the topic of [Racism on Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q8461&action=history). As you can see, it mentions the changes, datetime and the author who did the changes.

Furthermore, the API allows access to bots, which can perform repeated tasks automatically, for e.g. fetching informaiton, changing informaiton, etc. However, to avoid the abuse of this feature, the API has a rate-limitter in place to tackle spam.

People can also create new Wikipages. For instance, I create a wikipage about myself: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q111144377
My page has been assigned a persistent ID of Q111144377. This is unique for every page.
